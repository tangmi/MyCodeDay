            <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
            <p>Bring anything that you think will make yourself productive. You'll probably need a laptop. Anything beyond that is up to you!</p>
            <h3>Will there be food?</h3>
            <p>Yep!</p>
            <h3>Can I go even if I don't know anything?</h3>
            <p>Of course! Part of the fun of a hackathon is figurning out things as you go along. We'll also have some great
                <a href="./schedule.html">workshops</a> that you can attend. Or just hang out and have fun!</p>
            <h3>Do I need a group to attend?</h3>
            <p>We'll be forming teams at the event, so you don't need to know anyone beforehand. Just show up! </p>
            <h3>Is it possible to make an app or game in such a short time?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes! We're constantly amazed by the results of CodeDay events! Check out
                <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFSdUq1Gac">S.S. Halfling</a>, and
                <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G2RpJQ8yko">Running Blind</a>, both games led by students at
                Redmond HS in Washington.</p>
            <h3>Are there any more official rules?</h3>
            <p>Check out <a href="./rules.html">The Official Rules</a>.</p>
            <h3>How big are the teams?</h3>
            <p>We suggest 3-6 people per team. 8 is the absolute max. </p>
